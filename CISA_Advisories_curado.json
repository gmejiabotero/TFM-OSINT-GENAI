Akira ransomware threat actors, associated with groups such as Storm-1567, Howling Scorpius, Punk Spider, and Gold Sahara, have expanded their capabilities, targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger organizations across sectors including Manufacturing, Educational Institutions, Information Technology, Healthcare, Financial, and Food and Agriculture.\n* Discovery : Threat actors use command line techniques to accomplish network and domain discovery.\n* Lateral Movement : Threat actors use remote access tools and protocols like RDP, SSH, and steal Kerberos authentication tickets to move within networks.\n* Command and Control : Threat actors use Ngrok to establish encrypted sessions, SystemBC malware as a remote access trojan, and STONETOP malware to deploy Akira payloads.\n* Exfiltration and Impact : Threat actors use protocols such as FTP, SFTP, and cloud services to exfiltrate data.\n* Encryption : Threat actors use a new Akirav2 ransomware variant that enables faster encryption speeds and further inhibits system recovery.\nCISA and its partners strongly encourage organizations to apply patches for known vulnerabilities, especially those affecting VPN products and backup servers, and enforce multifactor authentication for all remote access services. Organizations should monitor unauthorized domain account creation and unusual network activity while deploying endpoint detection and response solutions to enhance security.",
